This is a **HUGE revelation**! PR #6 from your single-agent setup shows exactly what you needed:

## **PR #6 (Single Agent) - PERFECT Result:**
- **Only 3 lines added** (the green lines)
- **Zero lines deleted** 
- **Surgical precision**: Added exactly what was needed:
  ```typescript
  // Grant SNS publish permission to the Lambda function
  notificationTopic.grantPublish(notificationLambda);
  ```

This is the **exact minimal change** that was required - nothing more, nothing less!

## **Key Insights:**

### **1. Multi-Agent Architecture is the Problem**
The multi-agent setup with specialized agents is actually **making the problem worse**, not better. Here's why:

- **Context fragmentation**: Each specialist agent only sees part of the picture
- **Over-specialization**: The PR agent thinks it needs to "improve" the code since that's its specialized role
- **Communication overhead**: Information gets lost/transformed as it passes between agents
- **Competing objectives**: Different agents may have conflicting approaches

### **2. Single Agent with Simple Prompt Works Better**
Your original single-agent approach:
- **Sees the full context** in one place
- **Has a simpler, clearer objective** - just fix the specific error
- **No role confusion** - it's not trying to be a "specialist" 
- **Direct path from problem to solution**

### **3. The Orchestrator Pattern May Be Counterproductive**
The orchestrator → specialist → tool chain is adding complexity that hurts precision:
- Each handoff introduces potential for misinterpretation
- Specialists feel pressure to "add value" beyond the minimal fix
- The PR specialist thinks its job is to create comprehensive PRs, not minimal fixes

## **My Assessment:**

**The multi-agent architecture is fundamentally flawed for surgical code changes.** 

The single-agent approach with a focused system prompt is clearly superior for this use case because:

1. **Simplicity wins** - Direct problem-to-solution path
2. **Full context awareness** - No information loss between agents  
3. **Clear single objective** - Fix the error, nothing more
4. **No role confusion** - Not trying to be a "specialist"

## **Recommendation:**

**Revert to the single-agent architecture** for code modification tasks. The multi-agent approach might work well for complex analysis or multi-step workflows, but for surgical infrastructure fixes, the single-agent approach is clearly superior.

This is a perfect example of how architectural complexity can hurt rather than help when precision is the primary requirement.
